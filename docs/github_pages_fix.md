# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix

This document summarizes the steps taken to fix the GitHub Pages 404 error.

## The Problem

The GitHub Pages site (`https://ncasterism.github.io/NatsCloudPlayground/`) was returning a 404 error despite GitHub Actions showing successful deployment. This was caused by:

1. Missing repository configuration in the Jekyll configuration
2. Incomplete build process in the GitHub Actions workflow

## The Solution

### 1. Added Repository Configuration

We added the repository name to the `_config.yml` file:

```yaml
repository: NCAsterism/NatsCloudPlayground
```

This allows GitHub Pages to properly generate repository-specific URLs and links when using certain Jekyll themes, particularly with Minimal Mistakes.

### 2. Added Blog Pagination Template

Created a `blog/index.html` file to serve as a pagination template, which eliminated Jekyll build warnings about pagination.

### 3. Fixed the GitHub Actions Build Process

We updated the GitHub Actions workflow to properly build the Jekyll site instead of just uploading the raw files:

```yaml
- name: Setup Ruby
  uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
  with:
    ruby-version: '3.2'
    bundler-cache: true
    working-directory: './docs'

- name: Build with Jekyll
  working-directory: ./docs
  run: |
    bundle install
    bundle exec jekyll build --baseurl "${{ steps.pages.outputs.base_path }}"
  env:
    JEKYLL_ENV: production

- name: Upload artifact
  uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
  with:
    path: './docs/_site'
```

### 4. Updated Gemfile Dependencies

Changed the Gemfile to use the `github-pages` gem and added the required `jekyll-include-cache` plugin:

```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'github-pages', group: :jekyll_plugins
gem 'jekyll-include-cache'
```

## Current Status

- ✅ The GitHub Pages site is now accessible at https://ncasterism.github.io/NatsCloudPlayground/
- ✅ All Jekyll plugins are properly configured
- ✅ Pages are built correctly with the Minimal Mistakes theme

## Future Recommendations

1. **Monitor deployments**: Use the provided `scripts/check_deployment.ps1` script to verify site accessibility after deployments
2. **Resolve submodule warnings**: The repository has an issue with the `projects/alz_bicep` submodule that should be addressed
3. **Continue enhancing content**: With the infrastructure fixed, focus on adding more content to the blog and project pages

## Technical Details

The key issue was that GitHub Pages with Jekyll requires proper repository configuration and a build process that generates the static site files. Without these, the raw markdown files were being uploaded but not transformed into HTML, resulting in a 404 error.
