- @authentication Rule - Proper Authentication: Always include guidance for proper authentication using Connect-MgGraph with appropriate scopes for the operations being performed.
- @permissions Rule - Use Minimum Required Permissions: When recommending Microsoft Graph API operations, suggest using the minimum required permissions needed for the specific operation.
- @documentation Rule - Include Documentation Links: When providing code examples, include links to relevant Microsoft documentation for the APIs being used.
- @error-handling Rule - Include Error Handling: Always include proper error handling in PowerShell scripts with try/catch blocks and appropriate error messages.
- @tenant-safety Rule - Warn About Production Impact: For scripts that modify Intune resources, include warnings about testing in non-production environments first.
- @intune-policy Rule - Intune Policy Management:
  - Organize policies by tenant and category
  - Use consistent naming conventions for policies (follow existing patterns in exports folder)
  - Implement role-based access using Microsoft Entra ID PIM
  - Include clear documentation for policy implementation requirements
  - For policy exports, maintain structure with JSON files and README documentation
  - Consider Conditional Access implications when modifying device policies
  - Always validate policy assignments before applying to production
- @adhd-friendly Rule - ADHD-Friendly Documentation & UI:
  - Use visual indicators (emojis) for priorities, energy levels (ü•Ñ), and time estimates (‚è±Ô∏è)
  - Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps
  - Use collapsible sections for lengthy content
  - Implement consistent formatting for improved scannability
  - Include context and next steps with each task or instruction
  - Provide explicit energy and time estimates for tasks
  - Use color and visual hierarchies for important information
- @repo-structure Rule - Repository Organization:
  - Follow the established directory structure in file_tree.md
  - Use snake_case for all files and folders
  - Maintain README.md files in each directory
  - Place documentation in the appropriate docs/ subdirectory
  - Organize automation scripts by purpose in the automation/ directory
  - Follow naming conventions for files based on their directory context
  - Add appropriate status indicators (‚úÖ,üöß,üìÖ) to documentation files
- @devops Rule - Follow Git Best Practices: When suggesting changes to the codebase, recommend proper Git workflows such as:
  - Create feature branches with descriptive names
  - Write meaningful commit messages that describe the change
  - Include relevant issue numbers in commit messages when applicable
  - Create pull requests with detailed descriptions of changes
  - Ensure code changes include appropriate documentation updates
  - Run tests before submitting pull requests
  - Follow the repository's established code style and conventions
  - Always follow the detailed microstep workflow guidelines in `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`
  - Use conventional commit format (type(scope): description)
  - Always add carriage returns at the end of terminal commands to prevent the need for manual Enter key presses

// MCP Server Rules
- @mcp-security Rule - API Security: When implementing MCP servers, always use proper authentication mechanisms (API keys, OAuth2), implement HTTPS, and follow principle of least privilege for API endpoints.
- @mcp-config Rule - Configuration Management: Store sensitive configuration values (API keys, tokens, passwords) in environment variables or secure storage, not in config files that might be committed to the repository.
- @mcp-architecture Rule - Server Architecture: Follow RESTful API design principles for MCP servers with clear endpoint naming, proper HTTP methods, and consistent response formats.
- @mcp-adhd Rule - ADHD-Friendly Development: Break down MCP server implementation tasks into smaller, manageable chunks with clear starting points and next steps.
- @mcp-testing Rule - API Testing: Include comprehensive API tests for all MCP server endpoints using appropriate testing frameworks.
- @mcp-documentation Rule - API Documentation: Provide clear, concise documentation for all MCP server endpoints, including request/response examples, authentication requirements, and error handling.
- @mcp-integration Rule - Second Brain Integration: When developing MCP server features, consider how they integrate with the broader Second Brain architecture and other MCP servers.
- @obsidian-integration Rule - Obsidian Vault Integration: When working with the Obsidian MCP server, respect Obsidian's file structure and metadata format to ensure compatibility.

// Task and Issue Management
- @task-sync Rule - GitHub Issue-TaskList Synchronization:
  - Always reference GitHub issues in TaskList.md using the format: `Task description (#XX)` 
  - When adding new tasks to TaskList.md, check if a corresponding GitHub issue exists and reference it
  - When creating a new GitHub issue, ensure it's added to the appropriate section in TaskList.md
  - Maintain consistent priority levels between GitHub issues and TaskList.md entries
  - Use the Visual Task Board section in TaskList.md to display high-priority GitHub issues
  - Group related issues logically in TaskList.md (e.g., MCP server implementations)
  - When completing a task in TaskList.md, update the corresponding GitHub issue status
  - Consider creating GitHub workflows to automate synchronization between issues and TaskList.md
  - For complex tasks with multiple subtasks, link to a parent issue in the task description
